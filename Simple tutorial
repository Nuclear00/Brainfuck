# **Hello!** This is a very easy tutorial to know how to print characters in Brainfuck.

## So firstly, you have to understand the Brainfuck "symbols".

The loop is going until somewhere in the loop hits zerus (0).

Firstly, I think we should print a "Hello". It's going to look like this:

```
>+++++++[>++++++++++<-]>++.
>++++++++++[>++++++++++<-]>+.
>+++++++++++[>++++++++++<-]>--.
>+++++++++++[>++++++++++<-]>--.
>++++++++++[>+++++++++++<-]>+.
```
Let's break it down.:
>7+ - moves to the 2nd byte and increasing it's value to 7
[>10+<-] - starts a loop; moves to 3rd byte, adds 10 to it, goes back to 2nd byte and decreases by 1, and it does it until the 2nd byte hits 0.
>++. - moves to 3rd byte adds 2, and outputs.

It's like multiplication:
7*10=70
70+2=72=H

I think if you have time to experiment with it, you can learn the basics very quickly.
